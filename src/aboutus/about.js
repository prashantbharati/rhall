A firm believer in the vital need for eco-friendly technologies, Sai spends much of his time developing and incorporating these into his decade-long architecture and design practice. A chance visit to the township of Auroville some years ago, led him to develop a keen interest in mud-based construction, rainwater harvesting, and organic farming, and pursue these concepts with entrepreneurial vigour.
Sai affirms that long drives and working out are his keys to stress management. He is a vocal proponent of the superiority of Hyderabadi biryani and Irani chai."
