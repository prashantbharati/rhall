                Back in 2014, depleting groundwater levels and urban water
                shortage motivated Sai Renugunta to start an awareness-raising
                initiative. This eventually transformed into an enterprise that
                undertook more than 500 Rainwater Harvesting projects,
                consequently conserving approximately 50 million litres of water
                every year. During this process Sai was able to identify several
                concerns such as high price, product complexity, incompatibility
                with existing infrastructures, and lack of options for
                consumers. This led to the evolution of Rainmax â€“ a unique brand
                of effective, affordable and easy-to-use rooftop rainwater
                harvesting filters. Rainmax operates under the umbrella brand of
                UrbanEcology which offers consultancy services in sustainable
                architecture, earth-based building, and urban farming.

A firm believer in the vital need for eco-friendly technologies, Sai spends much of his time developing and incorporating these into his decade-long architecture and design practice. A chance visit to the township of Auroville some years ago, led him to develop a keen interest in mud-based construction, rainwater harvesting, and organic farming, and pursue these concepts with entrepreneurial vigour.
Sai affirms that long drives and working out are his keys to stress management. He is a vocal proponent of the superiority of Hyderabadi biryani and Irani chai."
